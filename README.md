## Motivations

This is a repository for creating synthetic population using census data (or other data sources).

Using synthetic populations can be beneficial in various fields and scenarios:

* Privacy Protection: Synthetic populations safeguard individual privacy by mimicking real-world patterns without exposing personal details.

* Simulation and Modeling: Ideal for simulating scenarios like public health management (e.g., disease spread), social wellbeing studies, urban planning, and traffic management. 
    
    * Synthetic populations enable the study of potential outcomes without using real-world data, which in most cases, is challenging to obtain or impractical.

    * Useful for enhancing datasets, synthetic populations generate additional samples, particularly valuable with limited or incomplete data.

    * Synthetic populations serve as benchmarks for testing and evaluating algorithms and models before application to real-world data.

* Education and Training: Synthetic populations provide realistic datasets for educational purposes, allowing students to gain practical experience without accessing sensitive information.

* Policy and Decision-Making: Synthetic populations assist policymakers in predicting the impact of different policies and decisions, aiding informed choices based on data-driven insights.

It's important to note that the use of synthetic populations depends on the specific goals of a project and the nature of the data needed. Careful consideration and validation are essential to ensure that synthetic populations accurately reflect the characteristics of the real-world populations they aim to simulate. This package provides a number of interfaces to make creating and validating synthentic population easier.
